# chrome-pdf-tracker

Chrome Extension that will help me keep track of all the CS ebook I read online. 
Ideally it will be able to automatically save the page I'm on. 

In Progress: 
- The extension is now retrieving pdf in my bookmarks
- The extension can now determine if i'm browsing a pdf
- the chrome PDF viewer uses shadow roots. The page number is saved in the #page-indicator div. The >>> or  /deep/ combinator is deprecated as of 9/8/2015. I'll need to find a way around it.
